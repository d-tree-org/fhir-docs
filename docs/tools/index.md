# FHIR Helper CLI

This is a collection of useful features for working with some of the resources in the FHIR spec for example the Questionnaires and Structure Maps.

## Install
Download the latests [release](https://github.com/d-tree-org/Fhir-Helpers-Extension/releases) and extract the content. 
Now you can run the `fhir-tools` script in the `bin` folder either running it directly or adding it to your environment variables.
